Custom applications are any third-party applications that are not provided in the DKP Application Catalog. Custom applications can leverage applications from the DKP Catalog or be fully-customized. No expectation of support by D2iQ exists for a Custom application. Custom applications can be deployed on DKP clusters or on any D2iQ supported 3rd party Kubernetes distribution.
