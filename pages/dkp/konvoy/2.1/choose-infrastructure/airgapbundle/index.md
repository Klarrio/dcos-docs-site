DKP comes with an easy way to deploy in an air-gapped environment. Rather than one large package that includes the requirements for all air-gapped environments, D2iQ now provides air-gapped bundles for individual needs. These sections cover the download, environment setup, and bootstrap cluster creation for air-gapped bundles.
